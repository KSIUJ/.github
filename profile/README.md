# Computer Science Students' Association of the Jagiellonian University

KSI (ξ, Xi) - the fourteenth letter of Greek alphabet (which you will learn at introduction to set theory)
has gained special meaning on the Jagiellonian University in Kraków.
This symbol means Computer Science Students' Association (Koło Studentów Informatyki = KSI = ξ) - organization, which should be known by
every computer science student on our faculty and in the world! Since 1976 we unite creative and curious people who don't want to limit
themselves only to mandatory classes.
